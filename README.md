## Features

- Get asynchronous resources ahead of time in the way you configure them.
- You don't need to change your code to use this tool.

## Install

```bash
yarn add vue3-router-prefetcher
```

## Usage

You need to use this plugin after `vue-router`:

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import { createRouter } from 'vue-router'
import Vue3RouterPrefetch from 'vue3-router-prefetcher'

const app = createApp()
const router = createRouter()
app.use(router)
app.use(Vue3RouterPrefetch)
```

Then you can use `<router-link>` without any changes, when this component is visible in viewport, it will automatically prefetch the (async) route component.

You can also register it as a new component instead of overriding `<router-link>`:

```js
app.use(Vue3RouterPrefetch, {
  name: 'QuickLink',
})
```

Now you can use it as `<quick-link>` in your app.
